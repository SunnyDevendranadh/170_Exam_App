        ],
        "explanation": "The key difference between KNN and K-means clustering is that KNN is a supervised learning algorithm (data points are labeled), while K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm (data points are NOT labeled). KNN classifies based on neighboring close proximity, while K-means clusters based on mean values (centroid)."

        ],
        "explanation": "In K-means clustering, the K value defines how many clustering groups to create. In KNN, the K value defines how many neighboring data points to consider when making a classification decision. This is a fundamental difference between these two algorithms."

          { "answerText": "KNN can only handle binary classification problems", "isCorrect": false }
        ],
        "explanation": "KNN is an instance-based, lazy learning algorithm. It doesn't build a model during training; instead, it simply stores the training data and postpones computation until classification time. This is why it's called 'lazy' - it doesn't learn a discriminative function from the training data but memorizes the training dataset instead."

        ],
        "explanation": "Feature scaling or normalization is often important for KNN because the algorithm relies on distance calculations. Features with larger scales can dominate the distance calculation, potentially leading to poor performance. Scaling ensures all features contribute equally to the distance calculation."

        ],
        "explanation": "A limitation of KNN is that it becomes computationally expensive with large datasets. Since KNN needs to calculate the distance between the new point and all existing points, the prediction time increases linearly with the size of the training set."

        "explanation": "Weighted KNN is a variant where neighbors that are closer to the query point have more influence on the prediction than those that are further away. This can be implemented by assigning weights to neighbors based on their distance, with higher weights given to closer neighbors."

          { "answerText": "Larger K values result in more complex models", "isCorrect": false },
          { "answerText": "Smaller K values result in more complex models", "isCorrect": true },
          { "answerText": "The K value has no effect on model complexity", "isCorrect": false },
          { "answerText": "The relationship depends on the dataset", "isCorrect": false }
        ],
        "explanation": "In KNN, smaller K values result in more complex models with more flexible decision boundaries that can capture finer details in the data. Larger K values lead to simpler models with smoother decision boundaries that may miss finer patterns."

        "questionText": "What is one advantage of KNN over other classification algorithms?",
        "answerOptions": [

          { "answerText": "It is less prone to overfitting", "isCorrect": false }
        ],
        "explanation": "One advantage of KNN over other classification algorithms is that it doesn't require any assumptions about the data distribution. It is a non-parametric algorithm that can work with any type of distribution, unlike some algorithms that assume a specific distribution (like normal distribution)."

        "questionText": "What is one disadvantage of KNN compared to other classification algorithms?",
        "answerOptions": [
          { "answerText": "It requires more memory to store the training data", "isCorrect": true },

        ],
        "explanation": "One disadvantage of KNN is that it requires more memory to store the entire training dataset, as it needs to keep all the training examples in memory to make predictions. This is in contrast to some algorithms that learn a compact model from the data."

        ],
        "explanation": "KNN can struggle with imbalanced datasets as it may be biased toward the majority class. Since KNN makes decisions based on the majority class among the K nearest neighbors, if one class is predominant in the dataset, it is likely to be overrepresented among the neighbors."

        "explanation": "While both KNN and radial basis function (RBF) networks use the concept of distance, RBF networks learn weights for the training examples (the centers and widths of the basis functions), adjusting the influence of each example. KNN, on the other hand, treats all examples within the K nearest neighbors equally (or based solely on their distance in weighted KNN)."

        "explanation": "Natural language processing is not a common application of KNN. While KNN can be used in some NLP tasks, it is not a standard approach due to the high dimensionality and sparsity of text data, which can make distance calculations less meaningful. More specialized algorithms like neural networks and transformer models are typically used for NLP tasks."
